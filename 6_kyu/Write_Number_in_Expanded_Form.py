# Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/expanded-notation.html). For example:

```
   12 --> "10 + 2"
   45 --> "40 + 5"
70304 --> "70000 + 300 + 4"
```

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
